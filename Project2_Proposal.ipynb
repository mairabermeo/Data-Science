        "This project explores how lifestyle behaviors, specifically sleep patterns, may influence academic performance among college students. Poor sleep habits are common in university settings and have been linked to reduced cognitive function, yet their direct relationship to academic outcomes remains underexamined in real-world data. This study seeks to identify whether variations in sleep consistency, duration, and timing are associated with changes in students’ academic achievement.\n",
        "\n",
        "To investigate this, we conducted a data-driven analysis using a combination of statistical and machine learning models. Our approach includes exploratory data analysis, feature transformation, and the application of several predictive techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data. By comparing multiple modeling strategies, we assess both linear and non-linear effects, as well as the potential influence of individual characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis reveals that certain sleep behaviors show a measurable relationship with academic outcomes. These findings highlight the role that sleep habits may play in academic success and offer insights that can inform future support strategies for student well-being and performance."

        "\n",
        "Academic performance during the first year of college is an important predictor of student retention, graduation, and long-term success. While universities invest heavily in academic support programs such as tutoring, advising, and orientation, personal habits like sleep often receive less attention. Many college students experience irregular sleep schedules, short sleep durations, and late bedtimes. Research has shown that sleep quality and consistency affect memory, focus, and overall cognitive functioning. Understanding how sleep behaviors influence academic outcomes could help improve student success and well-being.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates the relationship between sleep habits and GPA among first-year college students. We use data from the CMU Sleep Study, which includes information from 634 students across Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Washington, and the University of Notre Dame. Each student wore a Fitbit for one month, which recorded their sleep patterns, including total sleep time, bedtime variability, and daytime naps. The dataset also includes demographic information (such as gender, race, and first-generation college status), as well as academic data (cumulative and term GPA).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our primary research questions focus on whether longer or more consistent sleep is associated with higher GPA, whether daytime sleep has a positive or negative impact on academic performance, and how demographic factors influence these relationships. To answer these questions, we apply multiple modeling techniques, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, Huber regression, quantile regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. This combination of traditional and machine learning models allows us to evaluate both explanatory and predictive aspects of the data, fulfilling the project’s analytical and technical requirements."

        "Is there a relationship between daytime sleep and GPA, and does this relationship change depending on other sleep habits?\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these relationships can help schools promote better academic outcomes through simple behavioral changes. If students who sleep more or go to bed at regular times tend to perform better, schools can include sleep education in first-year programs. These might take the form of workshops, health campaigns, or academic coaching that includes advice on sleep routines.\n",
        "\n",
        "If daytime sleep is shown to negatively affect GPA, students could be encouraged to adjust their schedules to limit naps and prioritize nighttime sleep. By learning how small changes in daily habits affect academic performance, students may be better prepared to succeed in college. Schools can support this by giving students the tools and information to improve their routines in realistic and effective ways.\n"

Data were collected during the spring term of each student’s first year. Each participant wore a Fitbit device for approximately one month. These devices recorded sleep-related data, including total sleep time, bedtime variability, sleep midpoint, and daytime sleep. Researchers identified and classified sleep episodes using Fitbit tracking data. In addition to sleep data, the dataset includes academic records such as cumulative GPA (from prior terms), term GPA (from the spring term), and course load information.

Any columns that contain numeric values but are stored as object types will be converted to numeric using pd.to_numeric() to ensure proper analysis. Categorical variables such as gender, race, and first-generation status will be encoded numerically to prepare them for regression models. We will address missing values either by imputing them or removing affected rows, depending on the extent of the issue. If required, we will also normalize or standardize continuous variables like sleep metrics to ensure consistent interpretation across modeling techniques. The cleaned and prepared dataset will then be stored in a separate DataFrame for further use.\n",

We will generate a correlation heatmap using seaborn.heatmap() to visualize the relationships between sleep metrics and GPA. We will also create scatterplots to examine how TotalSleepTime and midpoint_sleep relate to term_gpa. To assess the distribution of academic performance, we will plot a histogram or kernel density estimate of the GPA. Additionally, we will use boxplots and violin plots to explore GPA variation across demographic groups such as gender or first-generation status. All of these plots will be coded in Python using matplotlib and seaborn.\n",

Continuous variables needed for distance-based models will be scaled appropriately. At the end of this stage, we will organize the final cleaned dataset into a new DataFrame, which will be used for modeling.\n",

To assess model performance, we will compute metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).For the Quantile Regressor, we will use Pinball Loss. For ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, we will generate feature importance plots to interpret which sleep or demographic variables most strongly predict GPA.\n",
